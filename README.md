# Sudoku

Solves sudoku puzzles using a brute force algorithm. Works well on generic puzzles, but there are some test cases where it gets tripped up, such as
```
[ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ]
```
